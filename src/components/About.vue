                                They say necessity is the mother of all invention. The story of Gamehub also 
                                started out of necessity at one of the best web & mobile application development 
                                firms in Bangladesh which is Augnitive. The idea of Gamehub came from playing 
                                PlayStation games during free time at the Augnitive office. Most of the team 
                                members wanted to play a variety of games but as you know game’s discs price 
                                is comparatively higher compared to PC games. There are already few Facebook 
                                groups that were selling games but the trust issue was always there and not to 
                                mention used games were not that cheap either. The idea was to make games available 
                                as cheaply as possible. The only option was to go for renting and to make everything 
                                super easy an online platform was the only viable option. Boom !!! GameHub was born.
