                                     <p>All prices and availability of games are subject to change without 
                                         prior notice and only the most current price is valid. You must pay 
                                         when you receive the game in hand via cash on delivery, bKash payment, 
                                         or SSL Commerce. The refundable membership amount does not include any rent. 
                                         It is simply a security deposit in case the disk is damaged or lost. You may pick 
                                         up your membership amount by canceling your membership or at the end of your membership

                                        after your game delivery. Any dysfunctional product will be replaced post

                                        the game disk including other charges. Any request in renewing or extending the 
                                        rental period after the renewal window will be considered null.</p>
