The story of Gamehub also started out of necessity at one of the best web & mobile application development firms in Bangladesh which is Augnitive.

There are already few Facebook groups that were selling games but the trust issue was always there and not to mention used games were not that cheap either. The idea was to make games available as cheaply as possible. The only option was to go for renting and to make everything super easy an online platform was the only viable option. Boom !!! GameHub was born.",
